# Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe game.
( Console based )

# Description

You can simply choose a symbol what you wanted to play whether it is X or O.

you on the other hand can freely choose where to put your turn.

TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(char playerSymbol);

        // start the game
        ticTacToe.start();
